## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
|   └── components/
|   └── layouts/
│       └── BaseLayout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
│   └── styles/
│       └── global.css
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

Added node adapter and SSR as default. To make a page static add to frontmatter:

```
export const prerender = true;
```

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
